# WHERE TO FIND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN RAILWAY

## Step-by-Step Visual Guide:

1. Open this URL in your browser:
   https://railway.com/project/f42f9123-6617-42b9-b17b-08dcb4656a9a

2. You'll see a page with:
   - Project name "LegalTrack" at the top
   - One or more SERVICE CARDS (boxes) in the middle

3. CLICK ON THE SERVICE CARD
   - It might say "LegalTrack" or show your backend service
   - It's a rectangular box/card

4. After clicking, you'll see a NEW PAGE with tabs at the TOP:
   
   Deployments | Variables | Settings | Metrics | Logs
                    ↑
              CLICK THIS TAB

5. In the Variables tab, you'll see:
   - A list of existing variables (might be empty)
   - A button: "+ New Variable" or "Add Variable"
   - Click that button to add each variable

---

## If You Still Don't See It:

The Variables tab might be called:
- "Variables"
- "Environment Variables"
- "Env Vars"

Look for any tab with those words.

## Alternative: Use CLI (Easier)

If you can't find it in the dashboard, just use these commands:

cd /Users/rishig/Downloads/praxis-plus-main/backend

railway variables --set "DATABASE_URL=your_neon_url"
railway variables --set "JWT_SECRET=xTs4ts/WPRsugSRr4W/rcM47EAtnyOQDo5nL932Ecig="
railway variables --set "JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d"
railway variables --set "ADMIN_EMAIL=dylan.barrett@embeddedcounsel.com"
railway variables --set "ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourPassword123"
railway variables --set "PORT=3001"

---

IMPORTANT: You MUST replace:
- DATABASE_URL with your actual Neon Postgres URL
- ADMIN_PASSWORD with your chosen password

---

The CLI method is actually FASTER and EASIER than the dashboard!

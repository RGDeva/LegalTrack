feat: add run timer, /log parser, billing codes, and invoice generator with EC template

Implemented comprehensive time tracking and billing features:

1. Run Timer Component
   - Added CaseTimer component with Start/Pause/Stop controls
   - Real-time elapsed time display in hh:mm format
   - Auto-creates time entries on stop with 6-minute rounding
   - Integrated billing code selection
   - Rate preview for Admin/Attorney roles

2. /log Command Parser
   - Parses "/log 11m description" format in Runsheet
   - Auto-rounds duration to 6-minute increments
   - Creates both runsheet entry and time entry
   - Live preview of parsed command

3. Billing Codes System
   - Seeded 7 default codes (001-007) as specified
   - Code 001: Managing case file
   - Code 002: Writing and emails, letters, and other communications
   - Code 003: Court events
   - Code 004: Drafting or reviewing documents
   - Code 005: Legal research
   - Code 006: Meeting or call with others
   - Code 007: Travel time
   - Role-based rate policies (Admin, Attorney, Staff)
   - Admin-only management interface at Settings → Billing

4. Invoice Generation
   - "Generate Invoice" button on Invoices page
   - Gathers unbilled time entries by case
   - Aggregates by billing code and description
   - Calculates total hours and amounts
   - Downloads text invoice (placeholder for PDF with EC template)
   - Marks time entries as billed

5. Role-Based Access Control
   - Admin: Full access to all features
   - Attorney: Can view rates and generate invoices
   - Staff: Cannot view rates or access billing settings
   - Implemented canViewRates() and isAdmin() utilities

6. Dashboard Enhancements
   - "Billable Hours (Month)" metric card
   - "Ready to Invoice" amount from unbilled time
   - "Active Timers" count (Admin only)
   - Role-based metric visibility

7. Data Seeding
   - 4 sample users (Admin, 2 Attorneys, Staff)
   - 7 billing codes with rate policies
   - 4 sample time entries for demonstration
   - Auto-seeds on first app load

Technical Details:
- Time entries stored in localStorage
- 6-minute increment rounding: Math.ceil(minutes / 6) * 6
- Rates stored in cents for precision
- Invoice generation marks entries as billed
- All existing UI/UX preserved
- TypeScript types updated for new data structures
- Build successful with no errors

Note: PDF generation using DOCX template is placeholder (text format).
Future enhancement will integrate actual EC Invoice Template.

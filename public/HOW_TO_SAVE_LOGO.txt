# How to Save the LegalTrack Logo

The logo file exists but is EMPTY (0 bytes). You need to save the actual image.

## Steps to Save the Logo:

### Option 1 - From the Chat:
1. Scroll up to find the logo image you uploaded in the chat
2. Right-click on the image
3. Select "Save Image As..."
4. Navigate to: /Users/rishig/Downloads/praxis-plus-main/public/
5. Save it as: logo.png

### Option 2 - From Downloads:
1. Find where you downloaded the logo image
2. Open Finder
3. Press Cmd+Shift+G
4. Paste: /Users/rishig/Downloads/praxis-plus-main/public/
5. Drag the logo image into this folder
6. Rename it to: logo.png

### Option 3 - Using Terminal:
If you have the logo in Downloads:
cd /Users/rishig/Downloads/praxis-plus-main/public/
cp ~/Downloads/legaltrack-logo.png logo.png

(Replace "legaltrack-logo.png" with your actual filename)

## Verify the Logo is Saved:
Run this command to check the file size:
ls -lh /Users/rishig/Downloads/praxis-plus-main/public/logo.png

It should show a size like "65K" or similar, NOT "0B"

## After Saving:
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Logo will appear in:
   - Browser tab (favicon)
   - Sidebar (top left)
   - Login page (centered)
